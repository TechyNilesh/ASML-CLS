To create a README file for running your script, you'll want to include several key pieces of information: a brief description of the script, requirements, how to set up the environment, and detailed usage instructions. Below is a template for a README file tailored to your script, which you can adjust as needed.

# README for Running the Script

## Description

This script allows for the execution of various machine learning models on specified datasets. Supported models include Hoeffding Adaptive Tree Classifier (HATC), Streaming Random Patches ensemble classifier (SRPC), Adaptive Random Forest classifier (ARFC), Online AutoML (OAML), AutoClass (AC), AutoStreamML (ASML), and EvoAutoML (EAML).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- gama
- river
- concurrent.futures (should be part of the standard library in Python 3.2 and above)

## Setup

First, ensure that Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, install the required Python packages using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas gama river
```

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing `run_script.py` and use the following command format:

```bash
python run_script.py --model_name <MODEL_NAME> --dataset_name <DATASET_NAME> --run_count <RUN_COUNT>
```

- `<MODEL_NAME>`: Short name of the model to run. Options include `asml`, `ac`, `oaml`, `eaml`, `hatc`, `srpc`, and `arfc`.
- `<DATASET_NAME>`: Name of the dataset to run the script on (e.g., `electricity`, `adult`).
- `<RUN_COUNT>`: Number of times to run the script. Default is 1 if not specified.

### Example Command

```bash
python run_script.py --model_name asml --dataset_name electricity --run_count 1
```

This command runs the AutoStreamML (ASML) model on the `electricity` dataset once.

## Note

Ensure that the dataset files are located in the appropriate directory as expected by the script. If you encounter any issues, verify the paths and filenames are correct.

Remember to replace any placeholder text with actual information relevant to your script and project. This README template provides a starting point, but you may need to add additional sections or instructions based on the specifics of your script and its dependencies.
