Given your folder structure and the provided Python script, I'll create a README file that includes instructions on how to run the script, along with a brief description of what it does. This README assumes that users have a basic understanding of Python and the command line.

# README for Automated Machine Learning Script

## Overview

This script facilitates the execution of various machine learning models on specified datasets. It supports a range of models including Hoeffding Adaptive Tree Classifier (HATC), Streaming Random Patches ensemble classifier (SRPC), Adaptive Random Forest classifier (ARFC), Online AutoML (OAML), AutoClass (AC), AutoStreamML (ASML), and EvoAutoML (EAML). The script is designed to run these models against datasets, allowing for multiple runs and providing flexibility in model and dataset selection.

## Folder Structure

Your project folder should include the following directories and files:

- `ASML/`, `AutoClass/`, `OAML/`: Directories containing scripts and resources specific to each model.
- `stream_datasets/`: Directory where your datasets are stored.
- `ac_run.py`, `asml_run.py`, `eaml_run.py`, `baseline_run.py`: Scripts for running specific models.
- `run_script.py`: The main script to run models on datasets.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `gama`, `river`, and others as needed by specific models.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas gama river
```

## Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command format in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python run_script.py --model_name MODEL_NAME --dataset_name DATASET_NAME --run_count RUN_COUNT
```

- `MODEL_NAME`: Short name of the model to run. Options: `asml`, `ac`, `oaml`, `eaml`, `hatc`, `srpc`, `arfc`.
- `DATASET_NAME`: Name of the dataset file (without the `.csv` extension) located in the `stream_datasets` folder.
- `RUN_COUNT`: Number of times to run the script for the given model and dataset.

### Example Command

```bash
python run_script.py --model_name asml --dataset_name electricity --run_count 1
```

This command runs the AutoStreamML (ASML) model on the `electricity.csv` dataset located in the `stream_datasets` folder, executing the script once.

## Note

- Ensure that the dataset files are correctly placed in the `stream_datasets` directory.
- Modify the script paths in the command construction within `run_script.py` if your folder structure differs from the expected setup.
